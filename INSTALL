Installation of repo-make
-------------------------

There are two ways to install repo-make:

1) PKGBUILD

Just run "makepkg -fc" in the top source directory to get a working
installation package that can be installed with "pacman -U".

2) Makefile

To install repo-make, type

make install

To uninstall, you may use

make uninstall

If you just call "make", then anything, the Makefile does, is to generate the
man pages.

The recommended call to package repo-add would be:

make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/path/to/packagedir install
